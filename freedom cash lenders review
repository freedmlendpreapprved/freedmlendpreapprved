freedom cash lenders review

Paycheck advance apps provide small advances of a few hundred dollars or less and take repayment directly from users’ bank accounts on their next payday.

Instead of a credit check, the apps typically review borrowers’ connected bank accounts to determine their advance limit and repayment date.

Though the apps review users’ transactions, there don’t appear to be safeguards that prevent borrowing from multiple apps at once, says Andrew Kushner, senior policy counsel with the Center for Responsible Lending.

The apps often ask for tips and optional express fees that reduce funding time from a few business days to a few hours or less — a significant difference for cash-strapped borrowers.
